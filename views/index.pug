        p For over 40 years Britain has been at the forefront of European politics. We have helped to build a strong and safe Europe where countries work together as partners and citizens can travel and experience other cultures.

        p Britain has led the way in Europe to support new laws incorporating rights for workers, access to healthcare and the creation of core human rights values in the European Charter. But these values are at risk if we leave the EU. Qualified EU staff would be unable to work in this country, animal welfare standards would decline, and the effect of Parliament shutting down is threatening our own democracy.

        p Leaving the EU will hurt the most vulnerable in our communities, give us lower living standards, and isolate us from the rest of Europe. We have worked hard for 40 years to make the EU the strong organisation it is today, and to walk away from our nearest neighbours would be a loss we would feel for years to come. We are better than this.

        p After three years of endless back and forth, we are still facing a No Deal Brexit with no information about what a future Britain might look like.
        p The Government is planning to shutdown parliament to prevent debate over its plans to deliver Brexit at any cost. Parliament has not been suspended in this way since before 1979.

        p Qualified nurses from European countries help the NHS provide health and care services.

        p Animal welfare and hygiene standards are regulated in the EU. 80% of British animal welfare legislation comes from EU law.

        p Trade deals outside the EU would open Britain up to lower standards and worse conditions for animals. For example, the USA gives growth hormones to their cows and still uses conventional battery cages for chickens.
